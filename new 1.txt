
Things that it needs to include:
--------------------------------

1. About finite volume.
2. About backward necessity -- and why we still do RK2 because it can work for the rest and for conductivity.
3. Explain fwd-bwd masking even though for heat we did not do it.
Can add additional detail -- heat method vs SDE.
4. About T hexagon -- where is this written out? -- how brilliant this has been. -- why necessary
5. Visc equivalent is tricky so here's what we did.
6. Solvers used; seeds; convergence criterion.
Empirically Jacobi & Richardson together get through quite a bit.
Look at ruminations about regressor sets.

Within the class of solvers that rely on choosing least-squares-optimal coefficients on a set of regressors,
we can describe them by the set of regressors used.

4DJ: why needful 
7. Nonlinear coping.
8. SIMD implementation notes.

. Summary notes about the INSULATOR : correct ways to handle.

At least 1 picture per section.


Writing all this out is not the work of 1 day.
Give it the proper amount of time. -- Looks like can do within 2 days really.
Imagine explaining to Jean or Ruslan.

Writing the list is not enough == have to actually write these sections.




Go over once then come back and go over some more.
As full of an explanation as seems right.

Devote time to it now.


Let's do a good job -- today, it's first draft of what I CAN say. Then go and do the giant historical review, look over 9 years for more additions tomorrow.
Today focus on what basically needs to be explained about how we have to do cond, and visc.



Note to self : if speedup of visc is desired, block level masking could save a lot of loading data into memory ? Just create the block mask following the individual one.
Be sure masking is on every routine.
